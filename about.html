								<h3>Our Mission</h3>
								<h4>Cyber Youth Tech (CyTech) has one mission: raise awareness about cybersecurity.   </h4>
								In this new digital era, the world has become more susceptible to the malicious actions of 								other from the the work of hackers to terrorist organizations. In order to prevent the 								exploitation of defenseless everyday people from being vulnerable against these actions, 								CyTech wants to better prepare everyone to protect themselves from all attempts at cyber 								crime. 
								<br> <br>
								This begins with changing the narrative on the idea of cybersecurity. When a pop-up appears 								on a screen, people's initial reaction is that it is an annoying obstacle in their 										productivity rather than an essential measure in keeping a system secure. These are the 									thoughts of the average day people that could be threatened by cybersecurity attacks.
								<br> <br>
								Visiting locations across the United States and United Kingdom, CyTech wants to change the 								perception so that everyone can take control and embrace cybersecurity rather than looking at 								it like it is a hindrance. Currently developing a tailored curriculum to introduce people of 								all ages to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), specifically in the realm of 								cybersecurity, CyTech is educating people on how to safely transverse technology as well as 								giving and starting opportunities in the field that otherwise would have never been possible 								to help them succeed.

								<h4>Our Beginning</h4>
								<img src="images/founders.jpg" style="height: 200px;"> <br> <br>
								<p> CyTech was started when the founders met in the selective US Embassy in London's Future 								Cybersecurity Leaders Exchange to share their passion and knowledge about cybersecurity. 								During this exchange, CyTech's founders realized how common the false "cybersecurity is a 								hindrance" narrative was and how they could come together to change that. In the formation of 								CyTech, the founders decided that the goal of the organization would be to bring awareness to 								the importance of cybersecurity by not only bringing attention to cybersecurity but providing 								students the ability to explore STEM in order to possibly lead them into the exponentially 								growing field of technology.
