								<h3>Our Mission</h3>
								<h4> Cyber Youth Tech (CyTech) as one clear mission: raise awareness about cybersecurity. </h4>

								The world is becoming susceptible to viruses, malware, hackers, and many more due to our
								new digital era. In order to prevent defenseless citizens from being vulnerable 										against malicious attacks in this age, CyTech wants to better prepare these 											cyber citizens' defenses from all attempts at cyber crime. Currently, CyTech is visting										different schools, libraries, and other organizations all over the United States and the 									United Kingdom. 
								<br> <br>
								CyTech is currently developing a taliored made curriculum to introduce people of all ages to 								Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), specifically in the realm of 										cybersecurity. While we want to educate people on how to safely trasverse this digital world, 								we also want to bring more people into the STEM field that otherwise would have never been 									give the  opportunity and help them to succeed by starting programs in areas that are lacking
								in STEM exploration.
</p>

								<h4>Our Beginning</h4>
								<img src="images/founders.jpg" style="height: 200px;"> <br> <br>
								<p> During the summer of 2018, our founders were chosen by the US Embassy in London 										to represent their respective countries in the Future Cybersecurity Leaders Exchange to share 								their passion and knowledge about cybersecurity. 

								Through this trip, our founders realized that compared to many others they had resources
								which allowed them to have been able to pursue their passions and interests in the tech field 								that many their age and younger did not have. In fact because of this issue, many their age 									may not understand the what cybersecurity is or even how to protect themselves when using 									using the internet. Knowing the importance cybersecurity as the modern world is developing 									new and innovative technologies, our founders decided to start a program that would allow 								them to educate others that otherwise would not understand the importance of cybersecurity 									and how to protect themselves from our digital world.
