		<h2> Our Story </h2> 
		<p> CyTech began in the United States when our founding members realized their potential to make a change. Originally created with the purpose to change 
			the perception around cybersecurity, our organizaion has completely expanded upon its initial mission. Wanting to use their given opportunities 
			and share that with the rest of the world, CyTech brought not only cybersecurity education but Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) 
			education to the workshops and events that we promoted and worked on. Bringing attention to not only cybersecurity but also STEM, CyTech
			has become an interntaional organization that is contiously expanding everyday. 
			<br> <br>
			With every line of code or another student taught, CyTech had created a curriculum and program that is bringing about the end of the divide
			in education and resources. Today, we work across the world to host our interactive presentation and activities in all parts of our community.
			In our time as an organization, we realized that we wanted bring computing education to all, inspiring future leaders as well as unlocking 
			people to their fullest potential.
